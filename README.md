Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:

- ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code
- React for client-side code
- Bootstrap for layout and styling

To help you get started, we have also set up:

Client-side navigation. For example, click Counter then Back to return here.
Development server integration. In development mode, the development server from create-react-app runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.
Efficient production builds. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your dotnet publish configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled JavaScript files.
The ClientApp subdirectory is a standard React application based on the create-react-app template. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run npm commands such as npm test or npm install.
